# Coursera_Capstone
In January/February 2021, I took a set of online courses on coursera.org to learn more about data science. This is the final project. The "Toronto neighbourhoods"
notebook was a loosely guided exercise and the "Battle of the neighbourhoods" was an unguided project using webscraping, geocoder, folium (map rendering), and
k-means clustering to cluster cities across Europe.
